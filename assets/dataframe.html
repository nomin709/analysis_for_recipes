Will be making these again, for sure! Thanks for posting the recipe!</td>

      <td>This was one of the best broccoli casseroles that I have ever made.  I made my own chicken soup for this recipe. I was a bit worried about the tsp of soy sauce but it gave the casserole the best flavor. YUM!  \nThe photos you took (shapeweaver) inspired me to make this recipe and it actually does look just like them when it comes out of the oven.  \nThanks so much for sharing your recipe shapeweaver. It was wonderful!  Going into my family's favorite Zaar cookbook :)</td>
